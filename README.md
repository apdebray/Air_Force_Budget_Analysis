# U.S. Air Force Budget Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the financial landscape of the United States Air Force using publicly released Department of Defense budget data from 2013. The goal was to extract insights relevant to **personnel retention**, **congressional budgeting**, and **resource allocation strategy**, particularly in the face of growing defense modernization demands.

The analysis blends **Python scripting**, **Excel modeling**, and **visual storytelling** to generate actionable takeaways for national security decision-makers and budget analysts.

## Motivation

As a U.S. Air Force Intelligence Officer and current Master‚Äôs student in Business Analytics at Purdue University, I wanted to investigate how budgetary shifts‚Äîparticularly in **R\&D, procurement, and personnel compensation**‚Äîmay affect operational capability and human capital retention. With growing concerns around recruiting and retaining talent in high-demand roles, this analysis offers data-driven insights with potential policy implications.

## Key Components

### üìä Notebook: `Air Force Budget Analysis.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook contains the end-to-end analysis, including:

* **Data sourcing** from raw Air Force budget spreadsheets and publicly available government APIs
* **Data cleaning** for complex multi-sheet formats using Python (Pandas)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Pay trends, procurement budgets, and historical R\&D comparisons
* **Visualizations**: Trends in officer/enlisted compensation, contracting priorities, and personnel attrition risk
* **Insights**: Links between spending structure and retention challenges across roles like pilots, engineers, and cyber operators

### üñ•Ô∏è Presentation: `MGMT 59000 Air Force Budget Analysis.pptx`

A distilled executive summary of the findings delivered for Purdue's MGMT 59000 capstone. Focus areas include:

* Strategic budgeting recommendations
* Retention leverage points through pay/incentives
* Visualization of FY2013‚Äì2020 trends across functional commands
* Implications for congressional appropriations and talent strategy

## Main Takeaways

* **Personnel Pay Gaps**: Certain high-demand roles show lagging compensation compared to civilian sector opportunities, indicating a risk for long-term retention.
* **Procurement vs. People**: Budget increases in systems and R\&D haven‚Äôt been matched by proportional increases in personnel investment.
* **Data Strategy Matters**: Python proved critical for transforming highly fragmented datasets into structured, insight-generating views‚Äîvalidating the utility of automated data pipelines for defense applications.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Languages & Libraries**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Excel
* **Visualization**: PowerPoint (MGMT 59000), Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Data Sources**: U.S. Air Force and DoD public datasets (2013+)
* **Applications**: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI (not in repo, used during ideation)
