# Air_Force_Budget_Analysis
I decided to take a look at a dataset that was put out by the U.S. Air Force in 2013. The data consisted of tons of different spreadsheets containing different numbers usually concerning spending and personnel.  My goal was to find insights to address retention issues within the military regarding pay and DOD congressional budgeting. 

Read the PDF and the powerpoint for the in-depth solutions and findings I discovered.
